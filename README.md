## Contributing to the project
For project epsilon we are using github as our version control. Whenever a change is made that is more than 10 lines or is not a bug fix, a pull request should be made with a branch name including the author's name, the affected function(s), and a suffix to indicate if the change is a fix. 

All tickets will be created on Jira to assign work to any given member of the project.

Finally, members will use Figma to create all mockups
