# Sprint 3 Retrospective
**Participants:** Artina Sin, Sarah Hameed, Kobe Louis, Hritik Gandhi, Weiyu Li, Daniela Venturo Esaine, Corey Fung.
## New User Stories:
No new user stories.
 
## Good practices
The following are some beneficial practices that we would like to carry on to the next sprint:
- Having frequent standups.
- Have a team meeting to practice the project demo before doing it with the TA.
- Refactoring before starting the sprint.
- Reviewing formatting of code such as using PEP-8 and snake_case.
- Having two people check the pull requests.
- Using the develop branch to merge every ticket branch into that and only merge into master at the end of the sprint.
- Deleting old branches.
- Add request handlers.
 
## New practices
Some practices we want to start using next sprint are:
- Tasks were more isolated to avoid conflict
- Frequently merged working branch with develop to avoid merge conflicts at pull request
- Separated DAO into multiple DAO modules for each class.
 
## Bad practices
The following are some bad practices we will avoid for next sprint:
- Leaving most reviews towards the end of the sprint
- Not updating JIRA when completing tickets or starting them.
- Choosing easier user stories. Even if it led to less stress on the team, we now have more harder user stories left.
 
## Experiences
A good experience was completing a lot of work by the half of the sprint even though it was not marked in JIRA. However, a bad experience was dealing with a lot of pull requests near the last day.
