## New User Stories:
No new user stories.
 
## Good practices
The following are some beneficial practices that we would like to carry on to the next sprint:
- Having frequent standups.
- Have a team meeting to practice the project demo before doing it with the TA.
- Reviewing formatting of code such as using PEP-8 and snake_case.
- Creating classes to represent DAO schemas.
- Having two people check the pull requests.
 
## New practices
Some practices we want to start using next sprint are:
- Creating modules based on the classes to organize the code better.
- Using the develop branch to merge every ticket branch into that and only merge into master at the end of the sprint.
- Deleting old branches.
- All new endpoints must have a link in the homepage.
- New additions towards the bottom of the file unless required elsewhere.
- Merge any new updates on develop or master into your working branch.
- Add request handlers.
 
## Bad practices
The following are some bad practices we will avoid for next sprint:
- Having loose endpoints (lost cohesion).
- Inconsistency between class attributes because of simultaneous work.
- Did not have a specific naming convention.
 
## Experiences
The best experience this sprint was getting everything to work in time for the deadline and getting all documentation ready. However, a bad experience was dealing with a lot of merge conflicts.
