# Sprint 1 Retrospective
**Participants**: Artina Sin, Sarah Hameed, Kobe Louis, Hritik Gandhi, Weiyu Li, Daniela Venturo Esaine, Corey Fung.
## New User Stories:
There is one new user story that will take two sub tasks that were not completed this sprint.
- EP-56: As a team administrator, I would like to receive a notification when a user makes a request to join my team.
    - EP-40: Push Notifications.
    - EP-41: Catch new updates to list.

## Good practices
The following are some beneficial practices that we would like to carry on to the next sprint:
- Having frequent standups.
- Have a team meeting to practice the project demo before doing it with the TA.
- Merging all branches with enough cushion time before the deadline.

## New practices
Some practices we want to start using next sprint are:
- Having a sprint planning meeting on the first Saturday of the sprint to start work early.
- Finish at least 50% of the sprint work by the first week.
- Have a better defined schema and plan for the classes so there is less mixup.
- Talk about file and class structure before coding for cross branch consistency.

## Bad practices
The following are some bad practices we will avoid for next sprint:
- Creating too many branches without needing so many.
- Having too many dependencies between tasks, which caused merge conflicts.
- Switching the tech stack close to the end of the sprint.
- Not coordinating class naming.

## Experiences
The best experience this sprint was definitely getting everything to work in time for the deadline even with all the mishaps. However, having to change from Django to Flask just a couple days before the sprint was ending was definitely the worst experience.
