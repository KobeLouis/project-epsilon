# Sprint 4 Retrospective
**Participants:** Artina Sin, Sarah Hameed, Kobe Louis, Hritik Gandhi, Weiyu Li, Daniela Venturo Esaine, Corey Fung.
## New User Stories:
As a job seeker, I would like to apply for a job so that I can join the company of my liking.
As a team administrator, I want to be able to post job opportunities so that interested applicants can apply.
 
## Good practices
The following are some beneficial practices that we would like to carry on to the next sprint:
- Having frequent standups.
- Have a team meeting to practice the project demo before doing it with the TA.
- Refactoring before starting the sprint.
- Reviewing formatting of code such as using PEP-8 and snake_case.
- Having two people check the pull requests.
- Using the develop branch to merge every ticket branch into that and only merge into master at the end of the sprint.
- Deleting old branches.
- Isolating tasks and user stories better than last sprints.
- Frequently merged working branch with develop to avoid merge conflicts at pull request
 
## New practices
Some practices we want to start using next sprint are:
- Having one person do the setup and having early PRâ€™s helped us avoid merge conflicts.
- Early set up of low level infrastructure
 
## Bad practices
The following are some bad practices we will avoid for next sprint:
- Leaving most reviews towards the end of the sprint
- Not dividing user stories into subtasks. Even if some features were done, since the user story encapsulated more features, it took longer to mark the entire story as done.
 
## Experiences
A good experience was to finally complete all the features for the MVP. However, a bad experience was finding some bugs in those features that need fixing.
