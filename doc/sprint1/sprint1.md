# Sprint 1
## Meeting Goal
Decide on the goals for sprint one and divide the tasks between the team members depending on their complexity and time availability. Another goal is to finish defining the technical stack for the project to start working on it.

## Sprint Goal
**Goal**:
- Complete the environment setup of the project including the basic flask project structure and mySQL local server
- Complete the backend of the team management page where teams can add, remove, promote, and see a list of their members, users can send requests to join.
- Have a functional frontend of the team management page, not necessarily yet stylized for the final delivery, that displays and reacts to the userâ€™s request. The frontend will be done in React.

**Team Capacity** = 11 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 18 + 10 + 12 = 84 total hours

## Spikes
### Functional
Practice merging pull requests successfully with multiple branches that touch the same files.
### Technical
Test flask-mysqldb python works well for our project by using it to build the team management database.
